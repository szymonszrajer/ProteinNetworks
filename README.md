# ProteinNetworks

In this project I compared different types of neural network architectures across different datasets. 
The three architectures I implemented are:

- FFNN with no convolution.
- CNN with one layer of convolution.
- CNN with five stacked layers of convolution.

Before testing performance of any model, an initial task was run in order to assess optimal way to pad sequence data.
